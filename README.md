# Cross-Wired-Robotics
LRCA FTC's Robotics Team

Hello all team members. I'm William Roach from the first year of our team. Below is the code you need for the robotics year for Android Studio.

The code you need to access and edit is in FTCRobotController --> TeamCode --> java --> org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.

OpTele is the program used for controlling the robot via XBox controller. The rest are for autonomous programs.

Good luck!
